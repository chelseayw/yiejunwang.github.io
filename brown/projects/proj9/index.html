                <div id="blurb">Abacus Healthcare Solutions is a consulting firm based in Cranston, RI that provides data-driven, client based medical solutions with a behavioral approach. Driven by a team of highly qualified experts in the field of healthcare quality research, Abacus needed a brand identity that reflected the systematic nature of the company. Upon research of international competitors in the industry, it became apparent that the existing Abacus identity lacked a competitive design.
