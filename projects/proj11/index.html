<h1>Salt & Pepper</h1>

<div id="h2">Logo, Identity</div>

<div id="blurb">A proposed identity for the Salt and Pepper Shaker Museum located in Gatlinburg, TN. The logo form is based off of the mineral and organic structures of salt and pepper. The visual identity conveys a symbiosis yet duality of the two elements.

I took the opportunity to design a informative landing page as well, introducing the museum as an introduction to the neighboring Great Smoky Mountains and drawing attention to its core values. </div>
