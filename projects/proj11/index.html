Foodio – a combination of "Food Studio" – is a mobile application that aims to motivate young individuals to keep track of their food choices in a personal, low pressure environment. The target audience are individuals who are familiar with social networking, take their diet seriously, live busy lives, and need an easy way to improve their lifestyle.
                <br/><br/>
The main features of Foodio include the camera, partners list, newsfeed, and personal statistics page. Every time a person records their meal, they are prompted to tag it with food groups such as Protein, Veggies, etc. This feature motivates users to achieve a balanced diet through visual introspection.

Collaborative 4 week project with Cathy Lee, Josh Inch, HyunJey Kim and Chuya Lee that was completed last Winter. I ensured consistent visual identity across pages and precision behind the interactions. View the <a id="link" href="http://invis.io/6UNGOCGR" target="_blank">original prototype</a> and <a id="link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3DquluKL7M" target="_blank">motion graphic</a> before I redesigned the interface.
