    <h1>Salt & Pepper</h1>
        <div id="h2">Logo, Identity</div>
            <div id="blurb">A four week effort into a proposed identity for the Salt and Pepper Shaker Museum, located in Gatlinburg, TN. The logo form is based off of the mineral and organic structures of salt and pepper. The visual tone is meant to convey a symbiosis yet duality of the two elements.

I designed an informative landing page that introduces the museum as a gateway to the neighboring Great Smoky Mountains and draws attention to the collection's core values. The subtle use of circular and rectangular elements alludes to the logo form.

My design process was very long winded. I researched the museum ethos, specific topics about salt and pepper, and even the eccentric shakers on display. I conceptualized ideas about contrast, pairing, overlap, dependency and play. Below are a just a couple of my initial sketches.
