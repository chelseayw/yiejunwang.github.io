<h1>Alexander Rodchenko</h1>

<div id="h2">Print, Typography</div>

<div id="blurb">A timeline illustrating and discussing the life and achievements of Alexander Rodchenko â€“ artist, sculptor, photographer, designer and pivotal leader in Russian Constructivism, as well as the various connections and context that impacted his work and set precedents for the future of design. 
<br><br>
Rodchenko's graphic work consists of a wide range of Soviet advertising propaganda utilizing bright and solid colors, thick and sharp lines, diagonals, inherent symmetry and bold lettering. In my timeline layout, I organized and divided the information in a way that reflected my personal style while working with geometric elements inspired by his design approach.
