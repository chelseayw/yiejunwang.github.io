<div id="blurb">This poster series is the culmination of a 4 part assignment - researching a given typeface, type designer and it's corresponding historical and cultural context, designing a 2D letterform combination typemark focusing on visual synthesis of form, and building a 3D version of the typemark and photographing it. Finally, 3 posters were designed which presented the research and images of the typeface. They are meant to work together as a series and individually.
