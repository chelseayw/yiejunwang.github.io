                <strong>Reelief is a proposed campaign and identity system for the conservation of coral reefs.</strong>
                <br/><br/>The logo is a typographic representation of the shifting underwater landscape. The brand identity draws attention to the aesthetic exuberance and natural abundance that reef plantlife contributes to our global ecosystem
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Context</strong>
                <br/><br/>
                Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems often referred to as "rainforests of the sea." They provide a home for 25% of marine species. They protect shores from the impact of storms, provide food benefits to humans and economic benefits from tourism. Coral reefs are dying around the world as a result of global climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing and inland pollution. Only 46% of the world's reefs are in good condition. Reelief promotes awareness of these issues in the application of its brand as well as public and didactic engagements. 
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Goals</strong>
                <br/><br/>
                Research, propose and brand a campaign for a cause I'm drawn towards, in a month. Utilize the potential of language (visual and verbal) to consider information distribution to my audience.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Process</strong>
                <br/><br/>In my initial exploration, I explored concepts related to ecosystem, layers, complexity and diminishment.
