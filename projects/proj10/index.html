<div id="h2">Digital, UI/UX</div>

<div id="blurb">Proposed web application that would aleviate the frustration of running multiple applications for various tasks, in response to the common issue of confusing desktop windows. View the <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/N71GY5DZV#/screens">prototype</a>.
<br><br>
It allows users to create multiple "workspaces" for each of their tasks and organize applications they normally use between work and play. Each space acts as a platform that would regulate the number of applications open on a desktop. It allows users to select specific apps to run at a time, streamlining the multitasking experience. It would motivate users to finish their tasks with minimal distration by using a time out feature on applications that are not work related.
<br><br>
I chose to base the design off the functionality of Google Docs and the aesthetic of Material Design to investigation conventions that most people are comfortable using.
