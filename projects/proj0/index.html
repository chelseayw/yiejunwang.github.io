                <div id="blurb">Alternate identity system for the Salt and Pepper Shaker Museum based off of opportune happenstance. The logo â€“ a fusion of s and p letterforms is loosely inspired by an ampersand. The characteristics of the design are meant to be minimal and focuses on the spontaneity and liveliness of sprinkles. Work in progress.
