                Foodio is a mobile app that visually documents an individual's food intake.  
                </strong>
                <br/><br/>
                Seeing and being aware of what you eat is a big step towards a healthier lifestyle. Foodio aims to motivate young individuals to keep track of their dietary choices in a personal, low pressure environment.

                <strong>Context</strong>
                <br/><br/>
                Getting healthy and losing weight is 80% diet. Therefore, we wanted to draw attention to eating habits. Diet/health apps like MyFitnessPal provide options to enter intake based on calories and nutritional information; Foodio differs in that it utilizes visual entries for personal introspection. We intended to "show, not just tell," and inspire conscientious eating.
                  <br/><br/>
                <strong>Goals</strong>
                <br/><br/>
                Work within a collaborative environment to concieve and deliver an app design in 4 weeks. My role was to ensure consistent interaction patterns across pages and establish a cohesive visual identity for Foodio.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Process</strong>
                <br/><br/>After getting survey feedback from students in the college demographic and finalizing a user flow, we divided the app into 3 logical sections: Profile, Camera and Partners List.

                <strong>Final Designs</strong>
                <br/><br/>After constructive feedback on Foodio, I decided to further solidify the visual language and interaction patterns. The light and fresh color palette appropriately compliments the imagery and the product vision.

                <strong>Reflection</strong>
                <br/><br/>This undertaking is my first product design endeavor in a subject that I'm passionate about! Looking back, I'm satisfied to have spent so much time establishing the foundations of the app interactions before heading towards the visuals. If given more time, I would consider alternative methods of tagging food submissions as well as find ways to bring nutritional data back into the equation.
